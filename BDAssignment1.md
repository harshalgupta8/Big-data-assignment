#### Various types of Computing

#### Parallel Computing 

* Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously.
* Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.

---

#### Distributed Computing

* Distributed Computing is a field of computer science that studies distributed systems.
* A distributed system is a model in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.

---

#### Cloud Computing

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

----
* In cloud computing, resources are pooled to serve a large number of customers.
* Cloud computing is based on self-service and on-demand service models.
* Cloud computing does not have any upfront cost. It is completely based on usage.
* Cloud computing must assure the best service level for users.

#### Grid computing 

Grid computing is a processor architecture that combines computer resources from various domains to reach a main objective. In grid computing, the computers on the network can work on a task together, thus functioning as a supercomputer.

---

#### Cluster Computing 

A computer cluster consists of a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together so that, in many respects, they can be viewed as a single system. Unlike grid computers, computer clusters have each node set to perform the same task, controlled and scheduled by software.

#### Flynn's Taxonomy

Flynn's taxonomy is a classification of computer architectures, proposed by Michael J. Flynn in 1966.  
Flynn's taxonomy is a specific classification of parallel computer architectures that are based on the number of concurrent instruction (single or multiple) and data streams  (single or multiple) available in the architecture.  
The four categories in Flynn's taxonomy are the following:
* (SISD) single instruction, single data
* (MISD) multiple instruction, single data
* (SIMD) single instruction, multiple data
* (MIMD) multiple instruction, multiple data

#### Why the need of huge computation power?

1. Highly complex problems
2. The rate at which technology in moving makes way for more computation power.
3. Huge amount of data to be studied so more power.
4. Personalised data of all the people in the world collected to provide them with updates about what they like.
